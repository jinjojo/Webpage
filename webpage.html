<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name’s Jojo. I’m currently at the age of 15 with my birthday being on August 1st.
I go to Northwest High School and am in <A HREF="https://girlswhocode.com/" >Girls Who Code</A>.
This is all about what I’m most fond of.</p>

<h2>How I came to know it</h2>
<p>When I was little, I never spoke too much.
It wasn’t really because I was shy, but rather I didn’t have much to say.
I never did much, until I was introduced to the wonders of the internet and computer at the age of 8 or 9.
When I first touched a computer, I couldn't get away from it. Along with learning about the computer,
I had discovered my two favorite interests: Video Games and Comics.</p>

<h2>Video Games</h2>
<p>This was the first thing I had discovered while on the computer. The first game I had ever played was known as Sims 2, a life simulation.
I would play this game for hours at a time, which wasn't good, but wasn't that bad either. I enjoyed every second I played.
At the time, I never really actually thought about wanting to make a video game myself, but I knew that I wanted something to do with it.
Along with the computer came the DS, Wii, XBOX, Iphone, and much more places to play video games. I still have all of them today.
Video games made me feel happy and comfortable at times when I needed it. It was when I got into highschool that I had discovered that I wanted
to give others that same feeling by creating them.</p>

<h2>Comics</h2>
<p>I never really bought the physical copies of comics. It never appealed to me and I never really had the opportunity to.
Instead, when I came to the age of 12, I had discovered the wonderful world of online comics. Some of the amazing comics I had read at the
time included: Karin, Kaichou Wa Maid Sama, Hiyokoi, and many many more. Sooner or later, I had also discovered <A HREF="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">Webtoons</A>, a comic reading
app. I had become very attatched to comics because of the way stories are made to become beautiful picture. This appealed to me very much.
When I got to highschool, I would start to make some little comics of my own for fun.</p>

<h2>Where I am now</h2>
<p>I'm currently studying ways to code games and creating my own ideas for future games that many would like. I am working to make sure that my future
will involve my two passions in some way, whether I do it independently or with others. Wherever I go, I hope to use computer science to create
interactive stories that can influence the world.</p>
